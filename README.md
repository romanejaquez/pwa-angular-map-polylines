# YouPS - Google Maps on an Angular PWA / Showing Route Polylines Between Two Points
### by Roman Just Codes (RJC)

This project is part of a series of projects in which I'll be developing an Angular PWA app for a fictional package delivering company called "YouPS". In this installment, I'll be displaying a route between two points in a map.

***NOTE**: YOU MUST HAVE THE GOOGLE DIRECTIONS API ENABLED AS WELL AS A GOOGLE MAPS API KEY FOR THIS TO WORK!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0-next.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
